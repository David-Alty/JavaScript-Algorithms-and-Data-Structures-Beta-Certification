// The sort() method in JavaScript is used to sort the elements of an array in place (modifies the original array) 
// returns the sorted array. By default, it sorts the elements as strings in ascending order.

/* 1. Default Sorting Behavior
If no compareFunction is provided, the sort() method converts the elements to strings and sorts them
lexicographically (dictionary order based on UTF-16 code points)*/

/*2. Using a Compare Function
To sort numbers or other complex data types correctly, you need to provide a compare function.

Compare Function Syntax
The compareFunction takes two arguments, a and b, and determines their order:

If compareFunction(a, b) is less than 0, a comes before b.
If compareFunction(a, b) is greater than 0, b comes before a.
If compareFunction(a, b) is 0, their order remains unchang*/
