/*In JavaScript, there are many built-in constructors that create objects.
 A constructor is like a regular function, but starts with a capital letter, and is initialized with the new operator.

For example, you can use the Date() constructor with
 the new operator to create a new Date object that returns a string with the current date and time:*/

const currentDate = new Date();
console.log(currentDate);
